# üåå **Cyclops: Your Adventure into Developer-Friendly Kubernetes**  

---

### **The Call to Adventure ‚Äì What is Cyclops?**  

In the bustling world of modern software, Kubernetes towers like a maze. Developers brave the wilds of **YAML** and **complex deployments** while product managers and QAs watch from the sidelines, unable to contribute meaningfully. Many have tried to conquer this beast‚Äîhours spent configuring manifests, sleepless nights debugging deployments. But no more!

Enter **Cyclops**, the one-eyed guide, **an open-source dev tool** designed to **simplify Kubernetes**. Cyclops extends its hand to developers, offering an intuitive **UI** that removes the need for tedious YAML configurations. The once-complex journey of **configuring, validating, and deploying** applications is now reduced to **a few clicks**.  

With **Cyclops's template system**, even the most intimidating Kubernetes setup becomes manageable. Templates, like magical artifacts, can be **customized** to fit any need, unlocking faster and easier deployments. **Cyclops** ensures everyone‚ÄîDevOps, product managers, developers‚Äîcan take part in the adventure.

---

### **Behind the Scenes ‚Äì How Does Cyclops Work?**  

**Cyclops isn't just a UI‚Äîit's a bridge between complex infrastructure and seamless collaboration.**  
Picture a world where your QA team and product managers create deployments without writing code. That‚Äôs the magic of Cyclops.  

For **DevOps wizards**, Cyclops serves as a mighty tool to build custom interfaces.  
For **developers and non-technical adventurers**, Cyclops provides predefined templates to get started without a hitch.

And here‚Äôs the twist‚ÄîCyclops doesn‚Äôt reinvent the wheel. **It uses Helm charts** behind the scenes, allowing you to integrate any of your existing Helm charts.  
Feel the need to explore? Use any **public Helm chart** with Cyclops and create UIs that will **simplify** even the most challenging deployments.

**Worried about not having a DevOps team?** Cyclops has your back with ready-to-use templates! **Deploy with ease** and focus on building your dream applications, without worrying about the minutiae of Kubernetes.

---

### **The Ritual ‚Äì Installing Cyclops**  

No adventure is complete without setting up the right tools. Here‚Äôs how to summon **Cyclops** into your Kubernetes cluster:  

#### **Option 1: Install with Kubectl**  
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyclops-ui/cyclops/v0.14.1/install/cyclops-install.yaml && \
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyclops-ui/cyclops/v0.14.1/install/demo-templates.yaml
```

This command creates the **Cyclops namespace** and deploys everything you need to begin your journey.

Now, all that‚Äôs left is to expose the **Cyclops server**:  
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/cyclops-ui 3000:3000 -n cyclops
```
Adventure begins at: **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**  

---

#### **The Power of the CLI ‚Äì Installing `cyctl`**  
For heroes who enjoy the command line, **`cyctl`** is your companion!  

```bash
brew install cyctl
```

With **`cyctl`**, you can:  
- Explore modules and templates with ease.  
- Automate deployments using **GitHub Actions**.  
- Integrate **seamless workflows** into your development process.

Publish your templates on **GitHub** and watch them connect automatically to Cyclops with **GitHub Actions**‚Äîgiving developers **instant access** to the latest updates.

---

### **The Treasures of Cyclops ‚Äì Templates**  

Every Cyclops instance is like a treasure trove of **predefined templates**. These templates reduce complex deployments into **simple, repeatable steps**.  

Want to explore these treasures?  
- Check out the Helm chart templates [here](https://github.com/cyclops-ui/templates).  
- Use the templates as guides to **create your own artifacts**.  
- Customize them to fit your needs, and **unleash the full power** of Cyclops.
